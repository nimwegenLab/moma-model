## About

This repository contains U-Net models for usage with MoMA. They were trained using training data from the [NimwegenLab](https://nimwegenlab.org/).

The Git repository [moma-model-training](https://github.com/nimwegenLab/moma-model-training) contains the code used to train the models. The table below links to the commit of this repository, which was used to train a model.

## List of U-Net models

:information_source:
Additional information for members of NimwegenLab can be found [here](https://github.com/nimwegenLab/moma-private/wiki/u-net-models).

The table below summarizes the U-Net models that were trained for MoMA. The columns are as follows:

- model file: name of the model file to be used by MoMA. The model files used by our group on SciCORE are located here: `/scicore/home/nimwegen/GROUP/Moma/MM_Artifacts/unet_models`
- training date: date when model was trained
- [moma-model-training](https://github.com/nimwegenLab/moma-model-training) commit: commit in the repository [moma-model-training](https://github.com/nimwegenLab/moma-model-training) that produced the model
